In this, I created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. The app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I also used the Moment.js to create the time responsiveness that appears on the page. To do that, I used var currentTime = moment().hours() and then I had a format part after the for loop.
